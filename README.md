# Draw me a Sheep üêë
This repository contains the pictures, data, script and figures for the work of Andres, Fueyo & Kiefer (2023) on the transmission chain experiment testing if people drew tails for sheep. 

All of the drawings of the sheep can be found in the "drawing" section. Condition 1 refers to the participants who were told to draw the sheep from memory, Condition 2 refers to the participants who were primed with the image "Mouton". Each image is labeled "Sheep_XXX" where "XXX" are three numbers. The first position refers to the initial condition (1 or 2); the second, to the transmission chain they belonged (1-5); the third, to the position within the transmission chain (1-6) they were in. This allows to track the evolution of the drawings. 

The data was collected on Saturday 13th of May, 2023 in Jardin du Luxembourg, Paris, France.
